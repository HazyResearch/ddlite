  On June 24th and 25th, we hosted a workshop at Stanford to talk about
  recent research around Snorkel, discuss applications and extensions, and most
  importantly from our end, get feedback on the upcoming v0.9 release of Snorkel.
  <b>This upcoming release is our most significant upgrade yet,
  integrating research work from the last two years</b>
  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10160">VLDBJ 2019</a>,
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05844">ICML 2019</a>,
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00417">SIGMOD 2019</a>,

  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01643">NeurIPS 2017</a>),
  new operators for building and managing training data, scripts demonstrating how to
  reproduce our recent state-of-the-art results on the public benchmark
  <a href="http://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/superglue.html">SuperGLUE</a>,
  and a full redesign of the core library!

  <br><br>

  We were lucky enough to have 55 of our collaborators and users attend this workshop,
  including members of industry (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and others), government,
  and medicine.
  In this blog post, we’ll describe some of the upcoming changes in v0.9 we’re most
  excited about, summarize and share the workshop contents, and most importantly invite
  your feedback as we prepare for the v0.9 release this August!

  <h2>Snorkel v0.9 Teaser</h2>
  Snorkel v0.9 integrates our recent research advances and Snorkel-based open source projects into
  <b>one modern Python library for building and managing training datasets</b>.
  In this release, we are:

  <ul>
    <li>Adding two new core data set operators &mdash; <i>transformation functions</i> and
      <i>slicing functions</i> &mdash; alongside labeling functions</li>
    <li>Upgrading the labeling pipeline using the latest frameworks and algorithmic research</li>
    <li>Redesigning the codebase to be a more general purpose and modular engine</li>
  </ul>

  We previewed these changes at the workshop, and are now sharing the
  <a href="#workshop-contents">workshop contents</a>
  below to get your feedback as well leading up to the release in August!

  <h3>New core data set operations: transforming and slicing</h3>

  We started building Snorkel in 2016, motivated by the increasing commoditization of ML models
  and infrastructure, and the increasing primacy of training data.
  We set out to create a framework where building and managing training data in programmatic,
  heuristic, or otherwise noisy ways was the primary mode of interaction with machine learning.
  To begin, we focused on one aspect of this broader set of activities: labeling training data,
  by writing heuristic <i>labeling functions</i>
  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723">NeurIPS 2016</a>,
  <a href="https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/weak_supervision.html">blog</a>).

  <br><br>

  <b>Our upcoming release adds two new core operations as first class citizens in addition to
  programmatic labeling.</b>
  The first is <i>transforming</i> data points with transformation functions (TFs), our
  general
  <a href="https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/tanda.html">framework for data augmentation</a>.
  The second is
  <a href="https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2019/06/15/superglue/"><i>slicing</i> training data</a>
  with slicing functions (SFs), in order to monitor and focus model attention on subsets of the
  training dataset where classification is more critical or difficult.

  <br><br>

  <div class="figure">
    <img src="june-2019-workshop-figs/fig_abstractions.png" width="60%" class="centered" />
  </div>

  <br><br>

  We’re excited to bring these concepts to the forefront of programmatic data set creation.
  Snorkel provides users with a flexible interface for applying state-of-the-art automated data
  augmentation techniques like
  <a href="https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/tanda.html">TANDA (NeurIPS 2017)</a>
  to their problems.
  Using this interface, attendees were able to reproduce state-of-the-art data augmentation
  techniques for text applications &mdash; as well as create original ones &mdash; in a single work session.

  <br><br>

  Slicing is a more recent research advance, but has already powered state-of-the-art results like
  our SuperGLUE system.
  Workshop participants were interested in more academic literature on slicing, which we’ll be
  releasing in the coming months.
  In the meantime, check out our
  <a href="https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2019/06/15/superglue/">blog post on slicing in SuperGLUE</a>
  and the slicing
  <a href="#workshop-contents">workshop materials</a> below.

  <h3>Upgraded labeling pipeline</h3>

  The programmatic labeling engine is getting updated to the latest and greatest.
  The new core generative label model uses the matrix-completion approach studied in our
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840">AAAI 2019</a> and
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05844">ICML 2019</a> 
  papers and implemented in
  <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal/">Snorkel MeTaL</a>.
  The label model is currently implemented in PyTorch, but we’re starting work on a
  TensorFlow-based and TFX servable version that many workshop participants requested.

  <br><br>

  <b>We're also providing native support for applying labeling functions using Spark and Dask</b>,
  making it easier to work with massive data sets.
  Spark integration in particular has been a common feature request, and this was echoed
  by the workshop attendees.

  <h3>General purpose engine for building and managing training data</h3>

  We redesigned Snorkel in version 0.9 to be a general purpose engine
  for programmatically building and managing training data sets across different domains
  and ML problem types.
  Whereas the current version of Snorkel is an end-to-end application for constructing
  information extraction models, version 0.9 is a library of modules that can be used
  in a wide range of applications.
  We’re keeping the core programmatic labeling functionality from the current version,
  but removing the extraction-specific tooling and database from the central library.
  <b>Workshop attendees were excited about this change, as they could see how to apply Snorkel to their
  ML use cases &mdash; whether they used text, image, or tabular data &mdash; in a straightforward way
  and integrate with their existing data infrastructure.</b>

  <br><br>

  Many of our workshop participants also expressed their interest in continued support of the
  current information extraction application version of Snorkel.
  We’ll absolutely be doing this, hosted in a new GitHub repo called <pre>snorkel-extraction</pre>
  which imports the central library in order to get access to the upgraded label model.

  <br><br>

  Our information extraction system is just one example of a Snorkel-powered
  end-to-end application.
  <b>We'll be releasing a host of other tutorials and examples in the next couple months.</b>
  They’ll have a new home in a dedicated tutorials repo, where you'll be able to see Snorkel
  applied to a wide variety of ML problems.

  <h3>A modern Python library</h3>

  Workshop participants were excited to learn that Snorkel will have modern installation support
  with pip and conda, as well as lots and lots of unit and integration testing.
  We also completed full API documentation &mdash; requested by just about every participant &mdash;
  during a sprint following the workshop.
  All of this will make it easier to get started with, receive support, and contribute to Snorkel.

  <br><br>

  Stay tuned for the full Snorkel v0.9 release post, where we’ll share more details and resources!


  <h2 id="workshop-contents">Overview of Workshop Sessions</h2>

  <br>

  </div>

  <br>

  The workshop was structured around the three core Snorkel operations: labeling,
  transforming, and slicing.
  Labeling functions were covered on the first day, and transformation and slicing
  functions covered on the second day.
  We also explored code from our state-of-the-art SuperGLUE submission,
  demonstrating transformation and slicing on several of the tasks.

  <br><br>

  The first half of each day was divided between presentations (both high-level and
  technical or theoretical deep dives for those interested) and Jupyter notebook-based
  tutorials.
  We had two hours of open "office hours"-style sessions in the afternoon during which
  participants could discuss potential use cases of Snorkel with us and each other,
  as well as explore the tutorial notebooks and ask questions.
  You can find workshop materials below!
