    "## Part 2: Writing  Labeling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snorkel, our primary interface through which we provide training signal to the end extraction model we are training is by writing **labeling functions (LFs)** (as opposed to hand-labeling massive training sets).  We'll go through some examples for our spouse classification task below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeling function isn't anything special. It's just a Python function that accepts a candidate, or a row of the DataFrame, as the input argument and returns `1` if it says the pair of persons in the candidate were married at some point,  `-1` if the pair of persons in the candidate were never married, and `0` if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are unipolar: it labels only `1`s and `0`s, or it labels only `-1`s and `0`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our goal is to ultimately train a high-performance classification model that predicts which of our candidates are true spouse relations.  It turns out that we can do this by writing potentially low-quality labeling functions!"

    "One powerful form of labeling function design is defining sets of keywords or regular expressions that, as a human labeler, you know are correlated with the true label. For example, we could define a dictionary of terms that occur between person names in a candidate. One simple dictionary of terms indicating a true relation could be:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    spouses = {'husband', 'wife'}\n",
    " \n",

    "**IMPORTANT** Good labeling functions manage a trade-off between high coverage and high precision. When constructing your dictionaries, think about building larger, noiser sets of terms instead of relying on 1 or 2 keywords. Sometimes a single word can be very predictive (e.g., `ex-wife`) but it's almost always better to define something more general, such as a regular expression pattern capturing _any_ string with the `ex-` prefix.
